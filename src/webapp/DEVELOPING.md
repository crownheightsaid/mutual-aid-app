Running the React app locally is easy since we use Create React App

`npm run local:react`

You can see the app at `localhost:3000`. Some pages will likely require the API. See `/src/api/DEVELOPING.md` for how to spin that up locally!

## Dependencies

It's easy to run the app, but some features require additional configuration.

## Environment

Starting the app requires a few environment variables. Folks can reach out for access to those variables in #wg_tech.
